# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Per-recipient outcomes now distinguish `delivered_remote` (a remote SMTP/LMTP
  relay accepted the message at handoff to a remote host) from `delivered_local`
  (a local Postfix transport/pipe/mailbox accepted it). The distinction is exposed
  in JSON so a downstream consumer cannot mistake a local hand-off for remote
  acceptance.

### Fixed
- A message handed to a local transport (e.g. `relay=mailreceipt`, `postfix/pipe`)
  is no longer reported as "accepted by the remote mail server (SMTP 2xx)". A local
  delivery now renders "Delivered locally — accepted by a local mail transport" with
  a caveat that explicitly makes no remote-server or SMTP 2xx claim. The receipt
  names the handoff it actually observed.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-06-08

### Fixed
- `filter` replies now render a formal plain-text receipt (labeled `MAIL DELIVERY
  RECEIPT` sections, word outcomes like `DELIVERED` / `NOT FOUND`), quoted-printable
  encoded — so conservative desktop mail clients show a readable receipt instead of
  raw Markdown. The Markdown output of `check` is unchanged.
- Subjects carrying RFC 2047 encoded-words (e.g. KOI8-R or Windows-1251 Russian
  subjects) are now decoded to Unicode in the receipt instead of appearing as raw
  `=?koi8-r?...?=` text. Falls back to the raw header if a charset is unknown.
- `doctor --format` now rejects unknown values (exit 1) instead of silently emitting
  text, and accepts the `markdown` alias consistently with `check`. The error and
  `--help` advertise all accepted values: `md`, `markdown`, `json`.

### Changed
- Added a dependency on `golang.org/x/text` (the Go team's extended-text package),
  used only to decode legacy non-UTF-8 mail subject charsets.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-08

### Added
- `filter` command — a mail-filter front door. Forward a sent email (the original
  attached as `message/rfc822`) to an alias, and mailreceipt replies to the sender
  with a cited delivery receipt. Authorization is the core: it acts only on an
  MTA-authenticated internal envelope sender, only when the trigger sender shares a
  configured `receipt_filter` team with the attachment's `From`/`Sender`, and only
  when the attachment's Message-ID correlates to a real local-log line — the
  attachment is a selector, never evidence. Fails closed (silent drop) on any
  unmet gate, with a loop guard (`Auto-Submitted`, `Precedence: bulk`).
- `receipt_filter` config block in `.mailreceipt.yml` (domains, teams, reply_from).

### Fixed
- **Citation verification now requires an exact full-line match.** Previously a
  truncated or edited citation could pass `verify` as long as it was any substring
  of a real log line — weakening the tamper-evidence guarantee. Citations must now
  match a complete source log line.
- **Recipient fallback is now time-bounded or `not_found`, never unbounded.** A
  pasted thread with no Message-ID and no parsable date previously searched the
  whole log and could assert a false `delivered`/`bounced` from an unrelated event
  for the same recipient. With no Message-ID and no parsable send time, the outcome
  is now `not_found` — the honest answer. Lenient `Sent:`/`Date:` values are parsed
  to bound the recipient-window correlation.

### Security
- The `filter` reply path is hardened: random per-reply MIME boundary, strict
  single-mailbox parsing for trusted reply identities (rejecting quoted/obsolete
  local-parts before they reach a raw `From:` header), base64-encoded JSON
  attachment, and a documented trust-boundary "Security model" section. An empty
  `--envelope-from` is an explicit fail-closed drop.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-06

### Added
- `doctor` command — diagnoses a mail log (exists, readable, non-empty, timestamp
  format, delivery-line count) so a `not_found` result can be distinguished from an
  unreadable or wrong-format log. Emits an ANCC-shaped JSON report with `--format json`.
- `init` command — writes a `.mailreceipt.yml` with project defaults (`log`,
  `log_year`, `case_prefix`). `check` and `verify` read it as defaults; explicit
  flags always override.
- `docs/SKILL.md` and an ANCC-compliant CLI surface — mailreceipt now passes
  `ancc validate` (0 failures) and carries the ANCC badge.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-06

### Added
- `mixed` overall summary for receipts whose recipients resolved to more than one
  outcome (e.g. some delivered, some not found). The Markdown headline states the
  mix — `Overall: Mixed — 4 delivered, 1 not found` — and the JSON artifact gains
  a `summary_counts` object with the per-outcome tally.

### Fixed
- The overall headline no longer contradicts the per-recipient table. Previously a
  single `not_found` recipient collapsed the whole verdict to `Not found` even when
  other recipients were delivered; the summary now faithfully compresses the rows.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-06-06

### Fixed
- Parse RFC3339 / ISO-8601 syslog timestamps (e.g. `2026-06-05T14:09:36.750604+02:00`), the modern rsyslog default on Debian 12+ and most current distros. Previously only traditional BSD timestamps (`Jun  5 14:09:36`) parsed; an RFC3339 log produced zero events and reported every recipient as `not_found` even when the message was delivered. RFC3339 lines are self-dating and ignore `--log-year`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-06

### Added
- Initial release: cited mail delivery receipts from Postfix logs.
- `check` — per-recipient delivered/bounced/deferred/not_found outcome with the verbatim log line as evidence; Markdown or JSON (`--format json`).
- `verify` — re-checks that every citation in a receipt still appears verbatim in the log.
- Message-ID correlation with recipient + time-window fallback; accepts an `.eml` file or stdin (RFC822 or a pasted top-of-thread block).
- `--case` reference stamping and `--log-year` for year-less syslog timestamps.
